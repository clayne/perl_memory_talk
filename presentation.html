# Perl, Caching, and Memory Leaks

Lee Johnson (LEEJO / leejo / lee@humanstate.com)

???

Warning! Possibly hand wavy in parts

My C is very rusty (although it seems people *want* rust rather than C these days?)

The perl internals are very deep, my knowledge of those internals is not deep

This is just the basics

---

## We've all heard of this?

--
* ### Make it work

--
* ### Make it right

--
* ### Make it fast

???
The oft missed additional clause

--
* ### Fix all the bugs you introduced by making it fast

???
Where "bugs" could be memory leaks

Immortal caches could be classified as memory leaks, if you have enough of them

More on this later

--

### But first a recap...

---

## Spot the bug

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>

int main() {
	int i, *ptr; struct rusage r_usage;

	getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF,&r_usage);
	printf("Start usage: %ld bytes\n",r_usage.ru_maxrss);

	for ( i = 0; i < 100000; i++ ) {
		ptr = (int*) malloc(1000 * sizeof(int));
		// do something with ptr ...
	}

	getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF,&r_usage);
	printf("  End usage: %ld bytes\n",r_usage.ru_maxrss);

	return 0;
}
```

???

It should be obvious, this is a talk about memory leaks

---

## malloc() but no free()

```c
for ( i = 0; i < 100000; i++ ) {
*	ptr = (int*) malloc(1000 * sizeof(int));
	// do something with ptr ...
}
```

--

```bash
> ./a.out
Start usage: 1675264 bytes
  End usage: 3538944 bytes

```

???
Process has doubled in size

We have to deal with this in C

---

## Clean up after use

```c
for ( i = 0; i < 100000; i++ ) {
	ptr = (int*) malloc(1000 * sizeof(int));
	// do something with ptr ...

	// and free up memory
*	free(ptr);
}
```

--

```bash
> ./a.out
Start usage: 1675264 bytes
  End usage: 1728512 bytes
```

???
Not a big deal in this trivial example

But imagine this is somewhere deep in a library, and part of a long running process

That's why we have tools like purify and valgrind

---

## What about Perl?

```perl
#!perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/ say /;
use Unix::Getrusage;

my ( $i,$ptr );

printf("Start usage: %ld bytes\n",getrusage()->{ru_maxrss});

for ( $i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++ ) {
*    $ptr = [ ( 1 ) x 1000 ];
    # do something with ptr ...
}

printf("  End usage: %ld bytes\n",getrusage()->{ru_maxrss});

exit( 0 );
```

???
It's not exactly the same, but close enough for what I'm getting at here

---

## Perl will handle memory usage for us

```bash
> perl leak.pl
Start usage: 4177920 bytes
  End usage: 4366336 bytes
```

???

We had a "pointer" to an array of 1000 ints, done 100,000 times over

Perl handled the memory allocation and freeing for us

--

### In Perl we don't have to worry about memory allocation ...

--

### Until we do

--

### Memory is cheap but not infinite

???

Or at least not infinitely fast

---

## On Reference Counting

```
perldoc perlguts
```

```
Reference Counts and Mortality

  Perl uses a reference count-driven garbage collection mechanism. SVs, AVs,
  or HVs (xV for short in the following) start their life with a reference
  count of 1. If the reference count of an xV ever drops to 0, then it will
  be destroyed and its memory made available for reuse.

  ...
```

???

---

## Devel::Peek


```perl
use Devel::Peek;

for ( $i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++ ) {
    $ptr = [ ( 1 ) x 1000 ];
    # do something with ptr ...
}

*Dump( $ptr );
```

---

## Devel::Peek

```bash
SV = IV(0x7fc9dc829350) at 0x7fc9dc829360
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (ROK)
  RV = 0x7fc9dc828958
  SV = PVAV(0x7fc9dc804e80) at 0x7fc9dc828958
    REFCNT = 1
    FLAGS = ()
    ARRAY = 0x7fc9dc600010
    FILL = 1
    MAX = 1
    FLAGS = (REAL)
    Elt No. 0
    SV = IV(0x7fc9dc8289f0) at 0x7fc9dc828a00
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
    Elt No. 1
    SV = IV(0x7fc9dc803270) at 0x7fc9dc803280
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
	... (repeated 1000 times)
```

???
This is the output from Devel::Peek::Dump(), I won't go into it other than to highlight (next slide)

---

## Devel::Peek

```bash
SV = IV(0x7fc9dc829350) at 0x7fc9dc829360
* REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (ROK)
  RV = 0x7fc9dc828958
  SV = PVAV(0x7fc9dc804e80) at 0x7fc9dc828958
*   REFCNT = 1
    FLAGS = ()
    ARRAY = 0x7fc9dc600010
    FILL = 1
    MAX = 1
    FLAGS = (REAL)
    Elt No. 0
    SV = IV(0x7fc9dc8289f0) at 0x7fc9dc828a00
*     REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
    Elt No. 1
    SV = IV(0x7fc9dc803270) at 0x7fc9dc803280
*     REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
	... (repeated 1000 times)
```

???
REFCNT - the reference count of each value

Notice that it's 1 for every value here

So when the top level REFCNT goes to 0 everything in this struct can be garbage collected

When does that happen (see two slides up?)

---

## How Leaks Happen

```perl
#!perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use feature qw/ say /;
use Unix::Getrusage;

my ( $i,$ptr,@arr );

printf("Start usage: %ld bytes\n",getrusage()->{ru_maxrss});

for ( $i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++ ) {
*     push( @arr,$ptr = [ ( 1 ) x 1000 ] );
    # do something with ptr ...
}

printf("  End usage: %ld bytes\n",getrusage()->{ru_maxrss});
exit( 0 );
```

???

Here's the same perl script with a subtle tweak.

Note I'm talking about subtle memory leaks here, this is a slightly contrived example to illustrate how it happens.

You can easily create death by "Out of memory!" by trying to read a 100GB file into an array, putting large amounts of data into global variables (another reason why they're bad), and so on.

---

## How Leaks Happen

```bash
> perl leak_2.pl
Start usage: 4005888 bytes
  End usage: 3261702144 bytes <--- Eeek!
```

--

```perl
use Devel::Peek;

for ( $i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++ ) {
*   push( @arr,$ptr = [ ( 1 ) x 1000 ] );
    # do something with ptr ...
}

*Dump( $ptr );
```

???
You probably *don't* want to run this

---

## How Leaks Happen

```bash
SV = IV(0x7f976c805420) at 0x7f976c805430
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (ROK)
  RV = 0x7f976c003280
  SV = PVAV(0x7f976c004e30) at 0x7f976c003280
    REFCNT = 2
    FLAGS = ()
    ARRAY = 0x7f976bf013a0
    FILL = 1
    MAX = 1
    FLAGS = (REAL)
    Elt No. 0
    SV = IV(0x7f976c0293b0) at 0x7f976c0293c0
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
    Elt No. 1
    SV = IV(0x7f976c028a98) at 0x7f976c028aa8
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
	... (repeated 1000 times)
```

???

See the difference between this and the previous Dump output?

    ARRAY = 0x7f976bf013a0

      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 1
	... (repeated 1000 times)
```

???

Because the global @arr points to this, so even when $ptr is overwritten in each
iteration of the loop there is still a pointer to the array(s).

So this REFCNT doesn't ever go to 0, we have a memory leak

## Leaks via Caching

- Cause::Campaign -> Donation
- Donation -> Cause::Campaign
- Roles to populate object attributes
- Wasteful to build the same object more than once
- Ephemeral Object Cache, sort of a singleton per unique entity
- Oops! Circular reference

---

## Detecting Leaks

- brute force
- devel cycle
- test leaktrace

---

## Fixing Leaks

- weaken
- weak_ref
- tweak logic
